# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

`ALSroads` is an R package for correcting, updating, and enhancing vectorial forest road maps using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. The ALSroads package is open source and integrated within the geospatial R ecosystem (i.e., `raster/terra` and `sp/sf`). The package utilizes the `lidR` package, developed for manipulating and visualizing ALS data. This user guide has been written to support users with variable levels of experience working with LiDAR data.

`ALSroads` was developed by [Roussel et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843222002084#d1e1483) for road extraction in forested regions and has been tested and validated in Quebec and Ontario. A comprehensive explanation of the road extraction method is available in [Roussel et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843222002084#d1e1483), as well as results from the method implementation in Quebec. [Morley et al. (2022)](tbc) validated the road extraction method for two forest management units in Ontario.

The current release version of `ALSroads` and the source code are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/ALSroads). In this user guide, we used version 0.2.0 of the `ALSroads` package.

Development of the `ALSroads` package was made possible by the financial support of the [Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs du Québec, Canada (MFFP)](https://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/).

Testing of the `ALSroads` package in Ontario was made possible by the [Forestry Futures Trust Ontario](http://www.forestryfutures.ca/) (Project number: KTTD 2B-2021) and an NSERC Discovery grant (RGPIN-2018-03851), grantee [Prof. Nicholas C. Coops](https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/nicholas-coops/).
